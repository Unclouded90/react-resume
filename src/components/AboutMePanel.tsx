          <p>
            Hello everyone, my name is Mauro. I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer, which I enjoy
            a lot. SInce I was young I love challenges, puzzles and logic-solving problems,
            so I feel I work as an hobby for a living.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very enthusiastic about everything I do, and I can't help but to keep improving
            myself over and over. For example - this website was constructed because I wanted to
            learn React. So, here we are!
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself to be a nice person, funny, a real friend to my friends. At the workplace,
            I prefer to be part of a team that has the same kind of personality - the kind of team that
            goes forward as group, supporting each other, while motivating everyone around themselves to 
            be the better version they can be.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working, I'm usually learning stuff, just like when I decided I wanted to learn
            React. I game a lot as well, I love listening to music and watching series/movies with my wife.

            So, that's it about me. If you want to know more, feel free to contact me using the Mail option,
            or if you prefer, connect with me on LinkedIn and we will talk more!
          </p>

    );
